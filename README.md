# README: How to Create an AWS EC2 Instance

This guide provides a step-by-step process to create an AWS EC2 instance, covering everything from naming your instance to configuring its details.

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- Basic understanding of AWS services

## Steps to Create an AWS EC2 Instance

### Step 1: Create a Unique Name for the Instance
1. **Log in to your AWS Management Console.**
2. **Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.**
3. **Click on "Launch Instance".**
4. **Enter a unique name for your instance in the "Name and tags" section.**

### Step 2: Select AMI (Amazon Machine Image) Type
1. **Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):**
   - **Navigate to the AMI selection screen.**
   - **Choose an AMI based on your requirements.** Examples include Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows, etc.
   - **Refer to the [Amazon OS Types documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/operating-systems-and-machine-types.html#prereqs-operating-systems) for more details.**

### Step 3: Select the OS Version and Architecture Type Suitable for the Application
1. **Choose the appropriate OS version.** Ensure the version you choose is compatible with your application requirements.
2. **Select the architecture type.** Typically, you can choose between x86 (32-bit) and x86_64 (64-bit) architectures.

### Step 4: Select the Instance Type
1. **Choose an instance type based on your applicationâ€™s needs.** The instance type determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance. Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities.
   - **For general purpose workloads**, you might choose t2.micro or t3.micro (both are eligible for the free tier).
   - **For compute-intensive applications**, consider c5.large or c5.xlarge.
   - **For memory-intensive applications**, choose r5.large or r5.xlarge.
2. **Review the instance type details** to ensure it matches your performance requirements.
3. **Refer to the [Amaxon Instance Types Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for more details.**

### Step 5: Configure Instance Details
1. **Click "Next: Configure Instance Details".**
2. **Configure network settings** as needed. This includes choosing the VPC, subnet, auto-assign Public IP, etc.
3. **Add storage** if needed. By default, an EBS volume is attached.
4. **Add tags** to help organize and manage your instances.
5. **Configure security groups** to control the inbound and outbound traffic to your instance.
   - **Create a new security group** or select an existing one.
   - **Add rules** to allow traffic (e.g., SSH for Linux or RDP for Windows).

### Step 6: Review and Launch
1. **Review all your settings.**
2. **Click "Launch".**
3. **Choose an existing key pair or create a new one** to SSH into your instance.
4. **Acknowledge the key pair warning** and click "Launch Instances".

### Step 7: Access Your Instance
1. **Navigate to the Instances section** in the EC2 Dashboard.
2. **Select your newly launched instance**.
3. **Copy the Public IP address** of your instance.
4. **SSH into your instance** using the key pair:
   - **For Linux/Ubuntu:**
     - Using OpenSSH:
       ```bash
       ssh -i "your-key-pair.pem" ec2-user@your-public-ip
       ```
     - Using PuTTY:
       - Install PuTTY if not already installed: `sudo apt-get install putty`
       - Convert the .pem file to .ppk using PuTTYgen:
         ```bash
         puttygen your-key-pair.pem -O private -o your-key-pair.ppk
         ```
       - Use PuTTY to connect to your instance.
   - **For Windows:**
     - Using SSH:
       - Use an SSH client like PuTTY, convert the .pem file to .ppk using PuTTYgen, and then connect using PuTTY.
     - Using RDP:
       - Ensure that you have enabled RDP in the security group settings.
       - Use the Remote Desktop Connection application to connect to your instance.
       - Enter the Public IP address of your instance and connect.
